### Overview
What I hope to complete with this project is to use available data collected on google searches to answer questions about restaurant business patterns. By using search patterns a relationship could be drawn from the amount of traffic activity online with the amount of clientle the restaurant receives at dinner time.

If this proves to be correct, I can generate a linear regression model to predict the average amount of guests expected to come in on a given day based on the web searches collected from local areas.

Because Google Trends has data that is scaled relative to its search activity within the area, I need to create a system of normalizing this data with itself from a scale of 0 to 1. I also need to normalize the Guest count and reservation data to do the same. Part of this process will include working with code that will use weighting function to assign a relative value of a Google search in relation with all searches in the area. 

Once the data is combined, I seek to find a correlation between the provided variables. If the relationship is strong I will generate a linear regression model to predict the amount of guests based on Google searches.
