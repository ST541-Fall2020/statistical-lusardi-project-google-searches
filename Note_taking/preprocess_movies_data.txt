Alright so I'm going to go through one of the data frames for the box office success prediction repository I'm working with the data file preprocess_movies_data dot R and I'm going to go through section by section the objective of this is to find out what each of the parts of the code does and on top of it whether or not it's relevant for the scope of project which is to load data frame with specific dates search terms and apply the functions and all of the packages that are associated with this to see if they actually matter or not when using it for a general project whether it be restaurants or a point of interest so we're starting with let's see we're starting with the first one which is loading the utils preprocessing This is going to be loading functions that are associated with the 

Preprocessing data file and we're going to look at forecast state and define search terms two functions that are the And we're going to be looking at how this actually works so we imported the movies CSV file you're going through and editing it doing some adding some features here majors independent studio filming company if it's independent these aren't really relevant they go forward and they take a log of the visitors over on the Premier weekend I'm not quite sure why they did that yet will come back to that the forecast horizon dates seems to be the most questionable function and I've already written to Manuel about it and it has to do with trying to edit the forecast window for the premiere date it starts with an argument of and I'll apply function that is going over and turning into a vector within the apply function there is the forecast date function and it takes on the arguments of date and forecast where date is a premiere date in post X form and forecast which is the number of weeks before Premier and its numeric argument this function doesn't seem to change when I applied to the premiere date which is really awkward and I'm not sure exactly why they made a function out of it and it doesn't seem to have any difference of time from the premiere date which is questionable as well the only thing I can see when in this chunk of code from 26 to 34 is that there isn't as diff time addition to the movies$ forecast start and that moves time in days just buy one from the premiere date is the only thing there's some other editing that is correcting movie titles and replacing all of these different patterns looks like they're preparing it for some Google searches and cleaning up some of the character strings and this last part about forecast horizon they saved two objects with last forecast date they apply that function once more of forecast date this time they have taken premiere date and they've applied a forecast of 1 meaning one week and they've applied it's even to a vector and they've saved that as an object of last forecast date will see what they use that later for they also truncated it which means that they've taken the mean of it and if it's less than the mean of what's in there it returns a zero in the units are days so zero days not sure what that means yet but we'll come back to it that ends the part for forecasting they also do defining search terms which seems to split the movie titles into character strings and so complex way of kind 

Process processing character data it seems to take the term and again this is going back to the preprocessing details are using a function called search terms define search terms actually and it's string splitting and it's putting in a lot of patterns at stubbing them out seems like they're just trying to clean up a lot of the characters and they've also taken that which returns a list of the actually three lists of all the movie names one list returns that the movie name the title the second returns the movie title plus the character or the string film added onto it and the third one seems to just be the complete title and that's just if that doesn't seem to be very significant to anything it just equals the term and it's just doing a little bit of replacement trying to see if it's yes there's another search term for that I think it's just trying to gather as much information on search terms that are related this could be useful maybe I have someone's trying to look for variations old spaghetti factory I could definitely see that this would be useful but we would have to do some heavy changing as to maybe pasting the word film and seeing what all the other arguments in these functions due to a movie term then at the End of it we've taken off the last bit of editing which is just going to be getting the season the month and the year if it's an even year ordeer and saving those as other features for the movie CSV and then at the end of it they just combine genres of fantasy and teenager film and save that as an R data file under the data repository so we can just see that there is some major movie heavy I functions going on here that we could definitely change where we would have to use a lot less to make these search terms work
