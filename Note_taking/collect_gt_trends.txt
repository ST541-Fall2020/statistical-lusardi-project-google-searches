This is my second note 4 the project for Google searches and I've come upon a point in the preprocessing part of the data where I cannot move forward with the time frame in week 9. Given unfortunately the amount of data that is associated with the functionality must be changed individually to a time frame of six weeks before the forecasted date this is ingrained into a lot of the functionality of the calculations given and they're not easy to fix because they are indexed as such and they are very difficult to automate as expected automation is a bit harder to do once it is made into a function that is specific to a time frame and to a specific weight.
Specifically I'm looking at the collect GT data terms our calculate Google values which seemed to be the essential part of the project the one that depends the most on scaling the anchoring terms and changing them they seem to depend a lot on the horizon which is going to be 6 weeks the trained data is made on that and it seems as if all of the matrices that are associated in the columns associated have to do with main title film secondary title and the aggregation there's calculations for weeks which is the initial scope of this experiment is to see the weekly visitors however because I have the availability of data within days

 I wanted to specify this I need to change this experiment instead of changing how the functionality of the titling goes for this project I need to find out how the functions actually work to go and dive deep into what the functions actually create calculating weights what does it mean for weekly data calculating weights for aggregated data taking the weekly mean a lot of these larger picture things what do they do to the data in the larger picture and how to break them down into more isolated tasks there is still further work to be done in this aspect and 
I will forego working with trying to replicate the project into my own but rather focus my energy on understanding what the project does and how to replicate that in my own code .
